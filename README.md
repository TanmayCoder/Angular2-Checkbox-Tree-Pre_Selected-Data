# Angular2-Checkbox-Tree-Pre_Selected-Data

This repository holds the TypeScript source code for an Angular 2 checkbox tree with some pre selected data<br>
The checkbox tree is based on the open source <a href="https://github.com/primefaces/primeng" target="_blank">PrimeNG tree component</a>.<br>
The tree supports partial selection when only some children are selected.<br>
You can use <a href="http://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/tree" target="_blank">PrimeNG tree attributes</a> to customize the tree look and feel.
